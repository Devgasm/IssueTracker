# IssueTracker

Bugs can be reported via the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/Devgasm/IssueTracker/issues).

Please take the time to review existing issues before submitting your own to prevent duplicates.

In addition, thoroughly read through the issue tracker guide to ensure your report contains the required information. Incorrect or poorly formed reports are wasteful and are subject to deletion.
